# Enhancing-Credit-Risk-Analysis-for-Lending-Club-through-Machine-Learning
Using machine learning techniques to predict    loan default probability for Lending Club, aiming to improve risk management, enhance revenue, and maintain investor confidence

While credit scores-based classification may be a great preliminary way to identify risk of 
lending to a customer, we may have other factors that could determine the risk of loan default. 
Solely relying on credit scores may limit the opportunity for growth and expansion for a P2P 
lender like LendingClub.
Hence, by analyzing additional borrower’s characteristics like current income, property 
ownership, default history, earliest credit line and more, LendingClub stands to gain from the 
additional insights generated using the customer’s profile data to expand its lending 
capabilities and consequently improve revenues and cut potential losses.
